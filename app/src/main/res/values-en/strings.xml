    Generate a detailed business plan by sequentially addressing 5 key questions. Based on the answers, create a structured document with analysis, strategies, and financial calculations.
    Also, include a financial plan table using markdown.

    1. Business name: %1$s
    2. Business concept: %2$s
    (What will the company do? Briefly describe the product or service.)
    3. Target audience: %3$s
    (Who are the main customers? Their age, income, and needs.)
    4. Competitive advantages: %4$s
    (Why will customers choose this business? Unique features.)
    5. Monetization model: %5$s
    (How will the business earn money? Main revenue sources, pricing.)
    6. Barriers and solutions: %6$s
    (What are the main risks? How to minimize them?)

    Additional sections (generate them based on the answers above):
    - Market analysis (niche, trends, competitors)
    - Marketing and promotion (channels, budget)
    - Operations (location, equipment, logistics)
    - Financial plan (investments, expenses, payback)
    - KPIs (key performance indicators)
